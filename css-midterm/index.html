        <h2>Symphony No. 41</h2>
        <h4>Composer: Mozart</h4>
        <p>
          Mozart's final symphony was also his best - and it's no coincidence
          that it's subtitled 'Jupiter', either. Mozart threw absolutely
          everything at this epic, his longest symphony. Marvel at the
          five-theme fugal ending, gasp at the quotations of plainchant motifs,
          and simply recoil in wonder at the majesty of it all.

        <h2>Symphony No.1</h2>
        <h4>Composer: Florence Price</h4>
        <p>
          In 1932, Florence Price took home first prize in a competition for her
          glorious Symphony No.1 in E minor, a thrilling four-movement work
          packed with soaring melodies. The following year, Price became the
          first African American woman to have her music performed by a major US
          orchestra, when her Symphony was performed by the Chicago Symphony.
          The music critic of the Chicago Daily News declared it “a faultless
          work, a work that speaks its own message with restraint and yet with
          passion… worthy of a place in the regular symphonic repertoire.”

      <div class="flexbox">
        <h2>Symphony No. 9</h2>
        <h4>Composer: Beethoven</h4>
        <p>
          Written when the composer himself was profoundly deaf, Beethoven's
          Ninth Symphony is without question, one of the greatest works in the
          classical repertoire, labelled by Classic FM presenter and Beethoven
          expert, John Suchet, as “the culmination of Beethoven's genius”. It's
          his longest and most complex, and that final hymnal theme, the 'Ode to
          Joy', has come to symbolise hope, unity and fellowship across borders
          and through conflicts. Today, it is the official anthem for the
          European Union.

        <h2>Symphony No. 2 ('Resurrection')</h2>
        <h4>Composer: Mahler</h4>
        <p>
          This masterful symphony was Mahler's most loved work during his own
          lifetime, and an absolute triumph at its premiere. Written across a
          six-year period, it represents the entire lifecycle of the human
          condition, ending with a triumphant, supernatural return to life. It
          requires at least 10 French horns, a load of church bells, two
          soloists and an immense choir, alongside the gargantuan sized symphony
          orchestra. Suffice to say, as live music experiences go, it's not one
          you'll forget in a hurry.
        </p>

      <div class="flexbox">
        <h2>Symphony No.3</h2>
        <h4>Composer: Louise Farrenc</h4>
        <p>
          Farrenc's Third is home to one of the most glorious finales in all
          symphonic repertoire, chocka with tense, agitated strings following a
          deceptively soft, melodic oboe and clarinet-based introduction. At the
          time of writing, Farrenc was unable to attend composition classes at
          the Paris Conservatoire, as they were only open to men.
        </p>

      <div class="flexbox">
        <h2>Symphonie Fantastique</h2>
        <h4>Composer: Berlioz</h4>
        <p>
          Is it a symphony? Or a symphonic fantasy or a tone poem? And does its
          five-movement structure actually take it a step away from the idiom?
          Well - what does matter, is that Berlioz wrote one of the wackiest
          pieces of music to come out of the Romantic period, while managing to
          make it a total hit and an artistically sound statement.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flexbox">
        <h2>Symphony No. 4</h2>
        <h4>Composer: Brahms</h4>
        <p>
          When the dust had settled from Brahms' first symphony (he was heavily
          touted in his day as the successor to Beethoven in symphony land), he
          set about creating one of the most consistent sets of symphonies in
          history. The fourth and final, composed up a mountain in 1884, has to
          be the best one though, proving to be one of his most emotionally
          daring works and sealing his reputation as one of the symphonic
          masters.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flexbox">
        <h2>Symphony No. 3 ('Symphony of Sorrowful Songs')</h2>
        <h4>Composer: Gorecki</h4>
        <p>
          A recording phenomenon in the 1990s, Gorecki's third is not only
          popular now: it's destined to be a future classic. The concept is
          innovative and watertight - a soprano sings three texts inspired by
          themes of parents and missing children over a sparse and simple
          orchestral backing - but it's the second movement that's proved the
          real winner. The text, taken from a message scrawled on the wall of a
          Gestapo cell in World War II, dovetails so perfectly with Gorecki's
          bare-bones accompaniment that it's impossible to imagine a future
          without it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flexbox">
        <h2>Symphony No. 5</h2>
        <h4>Composer: Shostakovich</h4>
        <p>
          Shostakovich wrote 15 symphonies in total, and he's unique in that
          almost all of them made an actual cultural impact. But of them all,
          the fifth has to be considered the greatest: sarcastic and funereal,
          inflammatory yet somehow managing to toe the party line - the final
          movement can be seen as both a parody of Stalinist excess, and an
          example of it - this was the symphony that made the young Shostakovich
          a name, for better or worse.
