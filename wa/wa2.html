      <h1>Hi, I'm Tori</h1>
      <!--intro-->
      <p>
        My pronouns are <i>she/her</i>, and my goal is to learn how to code
        sites properly and (hopefully) make a pretty site by the end of the
        semester.<br />
        I also am fluent in <b>Korean</b> and know Japanese as well as Latin
        (the dead language) to an extent ^-^<br />
        I like to draw and play video games in my free time :D I usually play
        steam games and sometimes online multiplayer games
        <s>(I am a League of Legends addict)</s>. I also listen to a lot of
        k-pop and j-indie/pop!
